# Smooth_IWP_code
The online repository for the codes to replicate the results in "Model-based Smoothing with Integrated Wiener Processes and Overlapping Splines"

## Scripts

The simulation/examples in the main paper are replicated in the following scripts. Specific points to pay attention to:
1. In each simulation/example, please make sure the working directory is correctly specified.
2. All the required R packages will be loaded in the R script, please make sure they are installed in the system before proceed.
